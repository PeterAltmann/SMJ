Dear Authors,

Thank you for submitting a revised version of your manuscript (SMJ-15-15771.R1) entitled "How resources are (not) altered: Divergent managerial resource schemas and the exercise of dynamic capability" to Strategic Management Journal. We have now received our two reviewers’ further comments on the manuscript. The comments can be found at the bottom of this letter.

While both reviewers commend you on the good work that you have done in the revision, they also continue to have further concerns with it. Based on their review comments and my own reading of your paper, I have decided to provide for you another possibility for a high risk major revision. In order to accomplish a successful revision, it would be important that you address at least the following two main issues:

(1) Novelty of the contribution. While you are clearly addressing an interesting topic area that has not received much attention in prior research, more work would be needed to further sharpen and substantiate the specific novel contribution is that your paper makes to the literature on resource schemas and dynamic capabilities. Reviewer 2 captures this well in her/his comment: “This study’s major finding seems to be that people in different departments have different schemas and this leads to a failure of the resource alteration process. The fact that different departments have different schemas or “thought worlds” that impedes innovation/ new product development is well known in organizational and marketing literature (see Deshpandé and Webster, 1989; Dougherty 1992; Homburg and Jensen, 2007). You are also familiar with aspects of this literature when you propose divergent resource schemas as a motivation to your study on page 1. “But not all managers…..well-documented.” Thus as a reader I feel that you are documenting something that has already been well established.” – In addition to demonstrating that discrepancies exist, it would be important that you develop further the idea of different resource schemas and why and how the discrepancies matter for capability development and for our understanding of dynamic capabilities. Thus, how does your study change the way we at present think about dynamic capabilities?

(2) Clarity of empirical evidence. Both reviewers also continue to have multiple concerns and questions regarding the empirics. For example, Reviewer 1 is concerned about the relative balance of power of the different functions and the effect that it has on the relevance of diverging resource schemas. She/He writes: “… how influential the two different functions were in regards to competence development. In many organizations HR is in a supporting role and has limited influence. […]. Divergent resource schemes are expected to matter more if this is the case for two functions that play a crucial role in the development of competences. For the product development unit this is obvious, for HR less so.” Similarly, Reviewer 2 challenges you with the specificity of different interpretations that you make based on your empirical observations and calls for “mapping on data to theoretical statements more clearly”.

In addition to these main points synthesized above, the reviewers provide a number of other valuable suggestions that may be helpful for developing your paper onwards. When you have completed the revision, you should again upload your revised manuscript and submit it through your Author Center.

Your paper has improved substantially. I like the way you frame it. The revised introduction and theory section work well and make it clear that you offer an interesting contribution. My remaining questions and comments are in regards to your case study.

The core idea of your paper is that divergent resource schemas shape the process of resource alteration. Empirically you are trying to show this by describing divergent resource schemas of HR and product development managers. This obviously requires different resource schemas to exist. On p. 19 you summarize the essence of this distinction in the following manner: “In contrast to product development managers who believed that existing competences could not be utilized due to an unfavorable context, human resources managers believed that the context had driven out suitable developers.” This makes sense but on page 35 you quote a human resource manager saying “it will not matter if we recruit innovative people into the current climate.” To me this suggests that HR managers were similarly aware and concerned about the context and climate that made it impossible for product developers to alter competences. In other words, this makes me wonder whether there is real divergence between resource schemas.

A second question I have relates to how influential the two different functions were in regards to competence development. In many organizations HR is in a supporting role and has limited influence. For example in recruitment they would help to organize the process but the decisions are taken by the respective managers who want to hire someone for their department. If a new person for the product development unit is hired it would be the product development manager who makes the final decision rather than a HR manager. If the role of HR is purely a supporting one, you need to consider this. Divergent resource schemes are expected to matter more if this is the case for two functions that play a crucial role in the development of competences. For the product development unit this is obvious, for HR less so. I don’t think it challenges your core idea that divergent resource schemes matter but it is important to understand how exactly plays out when the respective functions play different roles.

While you describe the divergent resource schemes well, I would like to learn more about the effect of this divergence. I appreciate that you mention the contestation but did this prevent the development of new competences? How did it shape the development of new competences? Your fieldwork took a little over a year and it is probably too short a period to see substantial shifts in competences during this period (this will depend on the development cycles). Hence I would be reluctant to accept a conclusion that the organization failed to develop new competences if you only consider the period of your field study. Your interviews should allow you cover a longer period and hence describe the effects of the divergent resource schemes on the desired outcome (i.e. development of new competences).

I still have some concerns about your data. I was surprised that after 16 months of fieldwork you only had 18 pages of notes and 52 pages of work diary. Can you explain why? To compensate for this I would suggest some additional interviews.

I hope my comments are helpful.

This paper addresses an important topic in the field of resource cognition- exploring how divergent resource schemas shape the resource alteration process. The author has revised her /his manuscript to address a number of the reviewers’ concerns about the theoretical framework and methodology. In this revision, he /she has also have tried to improve the sophistication of analysis in the methods section.

On a positive note this study investigates an area that is not well explored in strategy research. The research site is interesting, as is the data, which lend themselves to answering many interesting research questions that address the relationship between cognition and resources at a granular level. However, I have two main concerns with the manuscript: the first is to do with clarity of what the author is trying to state and the second is about the contribution.

In the introduction section you do not state the explicit contribution of your study. In page 2 you state that “the purpose of the study is to elaborate theory on how divergent resource schemas shape the way the resources are altered.” Also on page 3 before getting into the theoretical background you state that “The attempts to responds to environmental change can uncover such unrecognized congruences which managers must successfully resolve for a firm to successfully alter resources.” So as a reader I am assuming this is your focus and contribution: that is paper is about how managers resolve divergent resource schemas to succeed in the resource alteration process. Yet in the study’s findings do not get into these aspects clearly.

This study’s major finding seems to be that people in different departments have different schemas and this leads to a failure of the resource alteration process. The fact that different departments have different schemas or “thought worlds” that impedes innovation/ new product development is well known in organizational and marketing literature (see Deshpandé and Webster, 1989; Dougherty 1992; Homburg and Jensen, 2007). You are also familiar with aspects of this literature when you propose divergent resource schemas as a motivation to your study on page 1. “But not all managers…..well-documented.” Thus as a reader I feel that you are documenting something that has already been well established. Where can you slice the data here? Can you show how particular practices (within functional areas) create or sustain divergences? Can you show through a practice based lens as to why contestation and framing fails after divergences are noticed? This would imply looking the space between boxes C and D of Figure 1. What are some key insights that you can gain from the data other than the fact that different departments diverge in their resource schemas? A classic paper you might want to refer to for further ideas is “Technology as an occasion for structuring: Evidence from observations of CT scanners and social order of radiology departments” by Steve Barley (1986). In this paper he shows how identical CT scanners led to similar structuring processes in two radiology departments but led to different forms of organization.

In the theoretical background section you mention that you are looking into the processual nature of resources. This is valuable. Then you get into resource cognition and practice based perspective. So are you trying to contribute to the practice base perspective? Or if I go by your statement on page 7 you say that “the practice based perspective fits well with the study’s purpose to investigate how divergent resource schemas shape the unfolding process of resource alteration.” Then are you contributing to the resource cognition theory by bringing in practice based perspective to it? The relationship between resource cognition theory and practice based perspective is not clear. It might be better if you choose one or the other and from the paper I sense that you want to focus more on the practice based perspective.

In the theoretical background section you might also want to establish what you mean by practice. How is this different from routines or processes? May be an example from Getinge group on what is a practice and what is not practice but a schema or routine etc. will help readers to follow better.

I like that on page 7 you state that “While sharing a micro-level emphasis ... the strategy as practice perspective does not seek primarily to explain organizational performance but rather how practice both shape and are shaped by ongoing activity.” If you can define what you mean by practice in this section and how using this lens provides different insights into understanding divergence or contestation etc. might be an interesting contribution. Then you might take the Barley (1986) paper and the streams of paper after that (e.g. Barely and Tolbert, 1997) to elaborate upon your contribution.

Some questions on the methods section:

 New product development capability typically involves technology and customer capabilities (see Danneels, 2002). Why did you choose new product and human resources as the two functional areas to focus upon?

 Figure 1 needs to fit on one page. It is hard to read and understand

 On page 10, clarify what is a process driver. Furthermore, do you have a figure example or coding scheme that you could attach to the response letter that shows how you moved from maps or events to determining process drivers? (page 10) How did you determine which were the process drivers?

 It might help in this section how you differentiated between practice and resource schemas with quotes or examples.

 Also elaborating in this section how practice was interpreted differently by new product development and human resources will help readers in later sections. For example you state in page 11 that “For instance, lack of creativity among developers was highlighted by referring to a small number of ideas submitted in formal suggestion boxes. This led to another focal shift to practice based perspective.” Is this an example of the practice based perspective? Was it managers from HR or NPD that determined that small number of ideas indicates lack of creativity? You get to this later but showing divergences from the get go might give you more room later in manuscript to get at other theoretical contributions that you might make with this study.

The section “Introduction to Getinge Group” is interesting. However, some aspects are unclear and do not match the statements the authors make. For example on page 14 you provide quotes: “Getinge has gradually been increasing its product development programs, knowing that new products will have to account for a growing share of our total growth moving forward. We will remain intently focused in increasing our presence in emerging markets by developing unique and new products in the future that are adapted to these new markets with more purchasing power.” The authors state that these correspond to increased internal product development expenses and decreased spending on acquisitions. Many companies acquire companies in emerging markets to increase their presence there. Why is this quote indicative of internal product development instead of acquisitions? With the data you have it is easy to find other quotes that directly get at how the company moved away from acquisitions and started focusing on internal product development.

From the section “Divergent resource schemas and resource alteration,” here is what I understand from the paper:

1) Managers experience different contexts: I like this section. However, both sets of managers said that context was unfavorable. They did not have the people or the structures to enable radical innovation. So they are experiencing the same context but it is manifested differently. Can you find another example?

2) Managers experience the same context differently

3) They have divergent resource schemas and their proposed solutions differ: one involve leveraging existing product developers and the other involves releasing existing and accessing new product developers. The fuzzy front end exchange (page 23) distracts from the discussion. There needs to be a better connection of this exchange to the flow of the paper.

4) There is also asymmetric awareness of resource schemas that lead to tensions: the authors introduce the concepts of malleability and fungibility. It is not clear what the role of these concepts are in this stage of the discussion.

5) Ultimately it fails because of these differences

In the conclusion section you state that cognition treats properties as subjectively interpreted and practice based perspectives approaches results in everyday practice and both are linked. You also state the practices matter because they define schemas. This has also been already established in literature through the work of Feldman (2004). In that paper she argues that the resources enable actors to enact schemas. The focal contribution of that paper is that “understanding resources through a social practice perspective enables us more to understand about the role of resources in change.”(p. 295). Are you contributing to this view? What is your contribution? Are you challenging it?

In sum, although you have interesting data and raise interesting questions, at this stage what you are trying to accomplish is not clear. From the paper it appears that what you are trying to state has been already explored extensively in the literature. I like your study’s focus. Your study’s focus is intriguing and has potential to contribute to a topical discussion in the field. There are, however, a number of theoretical and empirical issues. Clarifying the writing, picking one or two strong theoretical anchors, mapping on data to theoretical statements more clearly and contrasting your contributions will make the manuscript strong. I wish you all the best in your work.
