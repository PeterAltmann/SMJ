Dear Authors,

Thank you for submitting a revised version of your manuscript (SMJ-15-15771.R2) entitled "Resource schema divergences and cognitive conflicts during resource alteration: The role of everyday practices" to the Strategic Management Journal Special Issue on “Strategy Processes and Practices: Dialogues and Intersections”. We have now received our two reviewers’ further comments on your manuscript. The comments can be found at the bottom of this letter.

While both reviewers continue to find the idea of resource schema divergence and cognitive conflicts interesting, they also continue to identify a number of areas requiring further development. This is quite problematic because at this stage of the process the manuscript should already start converging towards its final shape in order to make it to the Special Issue. The reviewers, however, continue to raise such fundamental issues relating to the positioning of the paper, clarity of construct definitions, interpretation of the findings, and the overall flow of logic that a convergence would not be guaranteed even on the next round. Therefore, I do not at the moment unfortunately have any other possibility than to reject the paper.

All hope is, however, not lost. –The official decision that I have entered to the system is “Reject and Resubmit” which means that if you choose so you can still submit a substantially revised version of your manuscript that takes into account the reviewer comments to a regular SMJ review process as a new submission. If you do decide to submit a revised paper as a new submission, please submit the paper via the regular SMJ submission process with a cover letter referring to this decision. Please note that because the paper will be considered a new submission it will be sent to a new editor and a new set of reviewers. If you are interested in having the paper come back to one of the Special Issue Editors, you can indicate Richard Whittington’s or Steven Floyd's name in the cover letter as they are also regular Associate Editors of the SMJ.

It is clear that your ideas have merit and that you have invested a good deal of work in this paper, so please do not be unduly discouraged. It often happens that a paper is acceptable for one kind of journal yet not publishable in another. Thank you for considering SMJ for your work. – I hope that the unfortunate rejection decision does not discourage you from sending your research to us in the future.

Once more, thank you very much for your submission. Good luck with continuing this line of research.

Best regards,

In the previous versions of your paper, your core idea was that divergent resource schemas shape the process of resource alteration. In a broader sense that is still true but the positioning has shifted substantially into the strategy as practice arena. As this is not a literature I am particularly familiar with, it is difficult for me to comment on value of your contribution.

Being more familiar with the literature on resources and capabilities, my sense is that you missed an opportunity here. The previous version of your paper took a promising direction. To what extent functional differences shape the resource development process is a very interesting question which we are unable to answer yet. As I pointed out before there are several issues you have to address before you can make a contribution in this regard. But once these issues are dealt with you end up with a truly attractive paper. My sense is that you decided to take a different direction with the paper rather than addressing these issues. I would still like a more careful consideration of the exact role of the two functions you study to determine how much influence they have on the development of new resources. And I would also need further clarification on how you were able to study the development of new competences, considering your period of observation versus the time it takes to develop them.

My suggestion would be to go back to the previous version of your paper and deal with these issues – if you can – rather than rewriting it such a radical manner as you did.  

Minor points:
In the response to reviewers you should have stated my comments rather than paraphrasing them. I had to dig up my old reviews to see what I actually wrote to make sure you interpreted me correctly.

On page 9 you refer to In Vivo. I think you mean NVivo, the software.

In the results section you use the term ‘Vignette’ several times. While this is commonly used in sociology, I would use the term case study here.

This paper addresses an important topic and investigates an area that is not well explored in strategy research - how everyday practices create divergent resource schemas that escalate into cognitive conflicts about how to alter a firm’s resources. The authors have revised their manuscript to address many of the reviewers’ concerns about the theoretical framework and methodology. In this revision, the contribution of the manuscript is also well highlighted in the introduction section. I commend the authors for their extensive revisions to reposition the manuscript. My comments in this version are geared towards clarifying the manuscript to highlight its contributions.

The theoretical question on how schemas diverge based on functional areas and how conflicts emerge that inhibit the resource alteration process is interesting. The research site also lends itself to answering many interesting question. However, my main concern with the manuscript is that the lack of clarity. The writing, data presentation and analyses makes it difficult to read. Thus the results are unclear and it feels that the manuscript falls short of the contribution that it is trying to make. It appears that the manuscript does not fulfill its promise in its current version.

In the introduction section the authors make a good case for why understanding the micro-foundations of the resource allocation process is important. They also explain how resource schemas are usually contested and subject to interpretation.  They state that their contribution is how everyday practices create divergences and how these divergences shape the resource alteration process (page 2, paragraphs 1 and 2).

In this paragraph they also use a number of terms that are not defined. What is a resource schema? What is a practice? What are keying and bridging practices? Keying is a term that is used in Goffman’s frame analysis (1974), but the authors do not cite Goffman. So it is unclear if they are using it in the same sense? In page 26 they also introduce keyed practices. Is keying same as keyed? What are the differences?  
In the literature review section the authors make a good distinction between practice and process research. They then define activity as moments of practice and distinguish between routines and practice and also discuss aspects of practical consensus. The authors do not tie these concepts back to the results section. So it appears that this discussion digresses from the paper. Is this paragraph needed?

On page 6 they define the research context of the two functional areas. It would be helpful in this section to define what the resources are. Are product developers the main resource that the authors are focusing on (human resources)? Or are NPD processes and HR processes also resources that are being analyzed (organizational resources)? Given that the focus of the paper is on resource alteration and schemas involved in resource alteration, it will be helpful to define which resources the authors are specifically focusing on. This confusion prevails later in the results section because what is the resource that the authors are focusing on and how they are altered is not well understood.

The methods section is well developed until Table 2. After that it gets unclear. The notions of what a practice theme and resource schemas are in “activity” and “interpretive” plane are not clear. Thus it becomes difficult to follow. For example NPD project management and idea inputs are practice theme. Idea inputs are a part of the NPD process. So why are these distinct practice themes? Similarly the authors discuss schema links. A schema link like “competences” cuts across regulatory compliance, idea input and talent management practices while other schema links are unique to a practice theme. How are schema links related to practice themes? And how does this help us understand the resource alteration process? Also why “guess work”, “problem/solution space” and other resource schemas are defined as such is unclear.

May be bringing in one or two quotes from Table 2 and applying different codes to show how these codes were generated and how they relate to each other at the granular data leel will help the readers follow along.

Then Figure 1 will provide a better abstraction.

The introduction to the Getinge group and the changes to the strategy and new commitments are well done.
Findings:

In the first half of the section what is defined as a unique practice, shared practice and unique and shared practices is not clear.  Why is idea management a unique practice while staffing a shared practice and number of standard components a unique and shared practice? This needs to be clarified.

Phase 1: Practices and early resource assessment

Unique practices and resource assessment: idea management practice is interpreted differently by NPD group and HRM group. While the HRM group believed that developers were not creative, NPD group believed that the process to capture ideas was flawed. So idea management practice reflected divergent resource schemas regarding developers’ capabilities.

Shared practices and resource assessment: in this section the focus is on the HRM/NPD staffing practices and not on the developers’ capabilities that seems to be resource that was considered in the previous section. Is the focus then on the resource management process rather than the resource itself? Or is the assessment at a different level (organizational) level rather than individual developers’ capabilities? Is there a shared practice that focuses on developers’ capabilities such that we can follow how resource assessments change between unique and shared practices?

Unique and shared practice: the number of standard components used in newly developed products is a shared practices where HRM practitioners interpret low creativity while NPD see it as a result of design constraints. Does this mean that NPD practitioners consider their developers to be creative? This is not clear. However in phase 2, it appears that R&D director (page 22) also believed that their developers lacked the necessary skills.

Phase 2: Resource alteration proposals and between functional area alignment

In this section the authors highlight that while HRM considered competence matrix and assessment of personality types, NPD practitioners saw various process barriers and short term financial focus as central. From vignette 1 it appears that HRM directors were also aware that the short term financial focus would inhibit effective hiring. So there is convergence as much as divergence.

Phase 3: Functional area cognitive conflicts and collapse of resource alteration work

In this the authors provide a clear example of how staffing was a contested turf. However how this relates to developers creative abilities or developers as a resource is not clear. This leads me back to the question. What is the resource and the resource schema that this study is considering? Developers? (human resources?) Staffing practices (organizational resources?) etc.

In the final section of the findings section the authors discuss keying practices, keyed practices and bridging.
Keying practices: As mentioned earlier in the review the notion of keying is not clear. Is strategy workshop a keying practice? What are the characteristics of the workshop that make it a keying practice? How did this keying practice influence resource assessment and alteration? Did it affect the assessment or did it surface the underlying issues? Can you weave into how keying practices relates to resource interpretation with examples?  

Bridging practices: Bridging is also a term that is used specifically in the framing literature (See Benford & Snow, 2000; Kaplan, 2008). How is bridging helpful in the resource alteration process?

Weaving in keying and bridging practices with different phases from the beginning of the results section will help readers understand the connections between the resource schema divergences, alterations and keying and bridging practices. May be start with figure 2 and explain the results section from there on? At this stage both keying and bridging practices are not well defined or integrated into the results section. So it is difficult to understand the process clearly.

The discussion section highlights why resource alteration disrupts current flow of activities and introduces a new equilibrium. It also explains how surfacing conflicts helps recognize them. It also emphasizes how cognitive conflicts hinder resource alterations.

I recommend that the authors look at Kaplan (2008) in terms of how data and analyses are presented in how framing contests occur and are negotiated. This might help with rewriting the paper.

In sum, I find this paper interesting in terms of its research question and the data collected through field research. It addresses an important question in the field of strategy. There are some paragraphs in the paper where the writing and analyses is creative (e.g. use of  Lamb et al’s work for coding). However lack of definition of key concepts, identification of what a resource is and what resource schemas are being considered in this study (human resources versus organizational resources) and integration of concepts (e.g. keying and bridging) throughout the manuscript makes it difficult to understand the paper and its contributions. I encourage the authors to continue refining their manuscript and wish them all the best in this process.
