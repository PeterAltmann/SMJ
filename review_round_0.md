Dear Authors,

Thank you for submitting your article manuscript (Manuscript ID SMJ-15-15771) entitled "Managerial resource schemas and strategic renewal" for consideration to the Strategy Processes and Practices: Dialogues and Intersections Special Issue of the Strategic Management Journal.

We have now received our two reviewers’ comments on your paper. The comments can be found at the bottom of this letter. Based on the reviews, we would like to provide for you the possibility for a high risk major revision. While the reviewers found your paper, and in particular the rich Getinge Group case analysis, insightful and interesting to read, there were also a number of major concerns that came up in the review process. In order to accomplish a successful revision, it would be important to be able to resolve at least the following core issues emerging from the two reviews:

(1) Theoretical framing. Both reviewers are concerned about the overall theoretical framing of your paper. For example, Reviewer 1 comments: “I don’t see a sufficient engagement with the DC literature. As DCs received considerable attention in recent years it would be sensible to discuss this literature and the role of managers prior to the method section. I also noticed that there are several contributions that link directly to your work that you don’t mention.” Similarly, Reviewer 2 writes: “Following the introduction, there is no theoretical background for the study. The area of cognition and organizational capabilities is a richly developed one (see Benner & Tripsas, 2012; Eggers & Kaplan, 2013; Gavetti, 2005; Kaplan, 2008 - Cognition, capabilities and incentives, AMJ, Parmigiani, A. & Howard-Grenville, J., 2011). This is concerning because it is difficult to infer the theoretical lens that you are focusing on. It is also important for a concise theoretical background section set the stage for your study and position your study’s contribution in the literature.” – Although Strategic Management Journal does not require manuscripts to make explicit contributions to theory, it is important that that they enable the strategy readership to gain a better understanding of the phenomena that are being examined either by introducing an interesting novel lens to analyze them or through the identification of novel dynamics that enable one to get new insights.

(2) Empirics. The reviewers also struggled with the methodological rigor and the depth and sufficiency of the empirical evidence that you provide. For example, Reviewer 1 notes: “I struggle to understand how much data you collected exactly. […] This raises both the question on whether you were able to collect sufficient data and more importantly about potential biases. At the moment you don’t provide sufficient evidence in your findings and analysis that your case study supports your arguments. I would expect more quotes and descriptions of specific incidents. Otherwise we simply have to take your word. Interviews would help you to gather rich data you can quote and offer triangulation.” Similarly, Reviewer 2 has a number of questions regarding data collection and analysis: “In your role as strategic coordinator you were able to access a multitude of documents. Which documents did you specifically focus on? What was your level of analysis?” – The comments and questions of our two reviewers provide for you good advice on how to further enhance the methods section. Clearly more details on data collection and further empirical evidence relating to the main arguments that you put forward in the paper would be needed in order to convince the reviewers that you observe what you claim. It may also be necessary for you to complement your data with some interviews in order to be able to respond to the concerns of our two reviewers.

(3) Novelty and overall significance of the contribution. Relating to the previous two points, the reviewers had challenges in pinpointing what is the specific novel contribution of your paper. It would be important that you sharpen this further. Developing your findings and arguments into the form of propositions could perhaps be helpful in forcing you to be more explicit arguments and in making the main novel results and arguments of your paper more tangible.

In addition to these main points synthesized above, the reviewers provide for you also a number of other valuable suggestions that are useful for developing your paper onwards.

Referee(s)' Comments to Author:

Reviewing: 1

In your paper you examine the role of managers in the development of dynamic capabilities. As I am no expert in Strategy as Practice my comments are primarily from the perspective of dynamic capabilities.

Link between your proposition and empirical investigation:

Your core proposition that managerial resource cognition will differ by department and therefore shape the development of dynamic capabilities is interesting. At this stage I am, however, not convinced that your case study demonstrates this very well. My expectation was that you are able to show how the departmental background of members of the Top Management Team influences their cognition and hence their contribution to the development of dynamic capabilities. Instead you seem to suggest in your findings that the CEO is responsible for corporate strategy while the different departments have to determine what that means for them and implement the strategy. If that is the case my question is how departments influence the development of DCs? The key to understanding your proposition should lie in the connection between the different departments and their joint role in developing DCs. The fact that HR for instance has to be involved in hiring people that work for NPD is not sufficiently new to make this an important contribution.

Should you decide to concentrate more explicitly on the TMT members and their departmental background you might find Kleinbaum (2012) helpful. He shows that atypical careers (i.e. careers that span across different departments) are beneficial. In your context this could mean that TMT members with atypical careers are important for the development of DCs.

Literature:

I don’t see a sufficient engagement with the DC literature. As DCs received considerable attention in recent years it would be sensible to discuss this literature and the role of managers prior to the method section. I also noticed that there are several contributions that link directly to your work that you don’t mention: Adner and Helfat (2003) introduce the concept of dynamic managerial capabilities. Stadler, Helfat, and Verona (2013) show how the impact of dynamic capabilities differs depending on whether firms access new resources or leverage them. This is a distinction that might help you to untangle the different role between top and departmental managers as well tension between what HR and NPD considers appropriate resources. Finally as you discuss the role of a changing environment, Schilke’s (2014) work on environmental dynamism and DCs should be helpful.

Richness of data:

I have a couple of suggestions regarding your data. First, I struggle to understand how much data you collected exactly. While you provide a good overview of the kind of data you have, you are not specific enough. How many typed pages are your field notes and transcripts from recorded statements? How many different documents do you have? How long are these? I would find a table similar to Ansari, Garud and Kumaraswamy (2015) helpful to understand this better. Secondly, I suggest that you also conduct interviews. You study a phenomenon for which documents are of limited value. Hence, your suggestions primarily rely on your own participation and the notes you took from these. This raises both the question on whether you were able to collect sufficient data and more importantly about potential biases. At the moment you don’t provide sufficient evidence in your findings and analysis that your case study supports your arguments. I would expect more quotes and descriptions of specific incidents. Otherwise we simply have to take your word. Interviews would help you to gather rich data you can quote and offer triangulation.

Table 1: you present some quotes here. Who are they from? Did you conduct interviews which you did not mention above? Again, this questions whether you have sufficient data to tell your story.

I hope my comments are helpful.

I was delighted to receive your manuscript given my interests in resource cognition and organizational capabilities. Upon reading your work I saw several positive features.

Firstly the use of resource fungibility and managerial resource schemas as theoretical lenses are interesting. In organizational settings where the nature of resources and their potential uses are contested, this is an informative lens.

Secondly, the use of qualitative data provides a granular understanding of this process. Finally this is a topical and interesting research area in strategy that needs further inquiry. However given that it is a first round of review I had some concerns.

My assessment is that overall, the focus of your work is intriguing and timely. You have rich data in a dynamic setting, which makes it possible to arrive at specific conclusions regarding managerial resource schemas and how it affects how firm’s dynamic capabilities.

However, lack of a theoretical lens, unclear writing and data analysis makes your paper difficult to understand or assess its import. Addressing some of these issues will enable you to communicate the value of your work to your audience. I have made some suggestions and provided some references in the attached document.  I wish you all the best in your revision process!


I was delighted to receive your manuscript given my interests in resource cognition and organizational capabilities. Upon reading your work I saw several positive features. Firstly the use of resource fungibility and managerial resource schemas as theoretical lenses are interesting. In organizational settings where the nature of resources and their potential uses are contested, this is an informative lens. Secondly, the use of qualitative data provides a granular understanding of this process. Finally this is a topical and interesting research area in strategy that needs further inquiry. Given that this is a first-round review I had some concerns as presented below:

1.In the introductory section, you emphasize the need for study in this area and the importance of your contribution (i.e., areas of resource cognition and the role of managerial cognition in the exercise of dynamic capabilities through a practice based view). There are two key issues here. Firstly your description of the relationship between managerial resource cognition and dynamic capabilities. Readers who are not familiar with these areas will not have a strong sense of what you are accomplishing in the introduction.  Secondly, the importance of the research question and why it is relevant is not clear. It is also not clear as to what your research is contributing over and beyond what is already known. For example, you refer to Dougherty’s work on thought worlds and differing managerial schemas based on Orlikowski’s & Gash’s work. What does your work surface that is not known already? Why is this research question important for the theory and practice of strategy? Overall, your introduction lacks strength does not capture what you are trying to accomplish to sufficiently motivate readers.

2. Following the introduction, there is no theoretical background for the study. The area of cognition and organizational capabilities is a richly developed one (see Benner & Tripsas, 2012; Eggers & Kaplan, 2013; Gavetti, 2005; Kaplan, 2008-Cognition, capabilities and incentives, AMJ, Parmigiani, A. & Howard-Grenville, J., 2011). This is concerning because it is difficult to infer the theoretical lens that you are focusing on. It is also important for a concise theoretical background section set the stage for your study and position your study’s contribution in the literature.

3. Your arguments for choice of the industry, access of real time data, how this is related to managerial schemas and inductive data analysis is persuasive.

4. In your role as strategic coordinator you were able to access a multitude of documents. Which documents did you specifically focus on? What was your level of analysis? For example, you state “how talent is assessed”- what specific schemas did you find here that you can tie back to your first order coding? An appendix outlining what a codified schema looks like as it relates to your variables of interest will be helpful in keeping up with your storyline. It will exemplify the unit of your analysis. Furthermore you had access to research diaries, PPT presentations, annual reports etc. How did you leverage these to include them in your study? Given the rich access to data it is possible to represent and draw conclusions at a more nuanced level.

5.  In the data analysis section you discuss coding schemes and draw upon frames. It is not clear how you move from managerial schemas defined as codified schemas, activities, and practices to the concept of frames in Table 1. How similar or how different are codified schemas, activities and practices to frames. Once again defining your unit of analysis is really important for taking your readers with you. What is your unit of analysis? How does this lead into an aggregate level of analysis. How did you arrive at the first order themes? In Table 1 you have a set of routines and schema. What were some others? What did you drop from your initial themes? What did you keep? What were your justifications? The readers require more in-depth description of how you conducted your data analysis. Look the book by Golden-Biddle, K., Locke, K., (2007). Composing Qualitative Research. : Sage Publications, to understand their recommendations on how to present statistical qualitative analyses.

6.  In the next section you discuss three senior level managers’ view of human resources. Here my biggest confusion was the confounding of aspects of human resources and aspects of processes, climate, culture etc.  For example on page 13 when you are discussing NPD director’s view on human resources there is a discussion of the NPD process and the stage and decision gates. Thus the discuss moves away from human resources which seems to be the focus of this study. Similarly unfavorable organizational climate is addressed in HR top management team’s work and view on human resources. These are also the sections where I began to get lost in terms of the direction of the manuscript and the analyses presented.

7. In Table 4, your determination of what is high or low in terms of managerial resource schema and how you arrived at that is not clear. For example, you suggest high “assumed fungibility” for CEO. You provide examples of this by showing how CEO assuming that NPD staff can develop solutions with economic benefits and that they can be used for affordable offerings as an example of “high” “assumed fungibility.” Similarly you state that using NPD staff to develop affordable offerings is also an example of “high assumed fungibility.” Finally, the instance HRM’s view of how existing sales staff can target new customer groups is  classified as “low” “assumed fungibility.” It appears that targeting new customer groups also requires high degrees of fungibility. It is not clear how you have made these determinations between high and low assumed fungibility. It is the same confusion regarding “emphasis on external fitness” and “assumed alterability.”
8. It was difficult to understand the contributions of your study and the conclusions that the readers should draw from it in the discussion section and conclusion sections. This mostly relates to difficulties in understanding the flow of the manuscript in the previous sections. You state that the study’s contribution lies in providing a description of how resources are understood by top managers based on their departmental membership. However there seems to be convergence in how NPD managers and CEO viewed the resources. It will be helpful to clarify how you arrived at convergence and divergence based on the data analysis section. The next question then becomes how does this study contribute over and above the “thought worlds” argument that we already know are different between different departments in a given organization? You also state that your contribution is in showing how the divergence affects linking of resources to strategic action. The way the manuscript is currently written does not address this issue clearly.

Overall, the focus of your work is intriguing and timely. You have rich data in a dynamic setting, which makes it possible to arrive at specific conclusions regarding managerial resource schemas and how it affects how firm’s dynamic capabilities. However, lack of a theoretical lens, unclear writing and data analysis makes your paper difficult to understand or assess its import. Addressing some of these issues will enable you to communicate the value of your work to your audience.  

I wish you all the best in your revision process!
